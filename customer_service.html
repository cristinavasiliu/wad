                                <p>Back in 2005, the internet was already wildly popular, but online shopping hadn't quite taken hold yet. Their plans to sell thousands of dollars worth of instruments, equipment and accessories online were met with laughter. Luckily they understood what their potential customers were looking for; one smart supplier understood that too and agreed to go into business with them. After that, the duo set to work putting a webshop online and renting a 500 ftÂ² storage space. In no time at all, they were shipping products far and wide, and Gamma Store was born.
                                <p>As musicians, we know that checking out gear at a physical store is an experience in and of itself, but we also know that not everyone wants to do that for every little thing they need. That's why it's important to us to be able to provide you with the best possible online store experience possible. That means we provide extensive product information, high-resolution photos and audio snipets so you can always find the perfect product.</p>
